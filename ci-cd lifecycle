🧩 1️⃣ Planning Phase (Ideation and Requirements)

Role: Product Owner / Business Analyst
Tool: Jira

Step 1: Create Stories

The Product Owner gathers business requirements and breaks them down into user stories — small, actionable tasks that represent features or improvements.

Each story includes:

A brief description of the feature (e.g., “As a user, I want to reset my password using OTP”).

Acceptance criteria, defining when the task is considered done.

Priority and estimation, to plan sprint cycles.

Tool: Jira

Jira is an Agile project management tool used to create, track, and prioritize these user stories.

It helps visualize work using Scrum boards or Kanban boards.

Stories are grouped into sprints, and progress can be tracked using burn-down charts and dashboards.

📈 Outcome: The development team gets a clear roadmap of features to build and release.

💻 2️⃣ Development Phase (Coding and Collaboration)

Role: Developers
Tools: GitHub, IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ)

Step 2: Take User Stories

Developers pick stories from Jira during sprint planning meetings.

They break down tasks further and begin coding using their preferred IDE.

Step 3: Commit Code to Git

After coding and local testing, developers commit their changes to GitHub—a version control and collaboration platform.

Git keeps track of all changes, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.

Developers create branches for features or bug fixes (e.g., feature/login-api), merge them via Pull Requests (PRs), and conduct code reviews.

Tool: GitHub

Stores and versions all code.

Integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins to trigger builds automatically after code pushes.

Maintains transparency across teams via pull requests, issues, and wikis.

📦 Outcome: Clean, version-controlled, and peer-reviewed source code ready for continuous integration.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Build & Package Phase (Continuous Integration)

Tools: Jenkins, JUnit, JaCoCo, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory

Step 4: Build Process

Once code is pushed to GitHub, it triggers Jenkins, a CI/CD automation server.

Jenkins pulls the latest code, compiles it, runs tests, and packages it into deployable artifacts.

Tool: Jenkins

Acts as the automation backbone for CI/CD.

Manages pipelines for:

Build automation

Testing

Deployment

Uses plugins to connect to tools like GitHub, SonarQube, and Docker.

Step 5: Code Quality and Testing

Jenkins runs automated unit tests using JUnit, which ensures individual code units work as expected.

JaCoCo analyzes code coverage—how much of the codebase is tested.

SonarQube performs static code analysis, checking for code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and security flaws.

Example: It flags hard-coded credentials, unused variables, or inefficient loops.

Tool: JFrog Artifactory

Once a build passes all quality gates, Jenkins stores the build output (e.g., .jar, .war, .zip files) in Artifactory, a universal binary repository.

Artifactory ensures consistent and versioned artifact management for deployments.

📦 Outcome: Verified and versioned artifacts ready to be deployed in different environments.

🚀 4️⃣ Deployment to Development Environment

Tools: Docker, Cloud Platform (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Step 6: Deploy to Dev Environment

Jenkins uses Docker to containerize the application.

Docker packages the app and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring it runs the same in all environments.

The container is deployed to a Development environment (often a cloud-based test server).

Tool: Docker

Simplifies deployments with containers that can be started, stopped, or rolled back easily.

Allows multiple environments (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod) to have identical configurations.

📍 Outcome: The app is deployed for developers to validate integration and functionality.

🧪 5️⃣ Test Phase (Quality Assurance)

Roles: QA Engineers, Test Automation Team
Tools: Docker, Cloud, Jenkins

Step 7: QA Testing

The build moves to the QA Environment, where quality engineers perform:

Regression Testing: To ensure old features still work.

Performance Testing: To check app speed and scalability.

Integration Testing: To verify services interact correctly.

Step 8: UAT Testing

After QA approval, the build is moved to the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment.

Business stakeholders and end-users test features for usability, design, and alignment with requirements.

📊 Outcome: The build is validated for both technical and business requirements, ready for production release.

☁️ 6️⃣ Release / Production Phase

Roles: Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), DevOps Team
Tools: Docker, Prometheus, SkyWalking, Cloud

Step 9: Production Deployment

The final, tested container is deployed to the Production Environment (live system).

This environment serves real users and must maintain 99.9%+ uptime.

Tool: Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting system that collects metrics (CPU, memory, request rate, latency, etc.) from servers and containers.

Alerts are configured for critical thresholds — for example, “if CPU usage > 90% for 5 minutes, trigger an alert.”

Tool: SkyWalking

SkyWalking is an APM (Application Performance Monitoring) and tracing tool used to monitor distributed microservices.

It helps visualize request paths, detect bottlenecks, and trace latency across multiple services.

SRE Role

Site Reliability Engineers continuously monitor system performance, handle alerts, and manage incident escalation.

They also ensure deployment reliability via:

Canary Deployments: Gradually releasing features to a small set of users before full rollout.

Feature Toggles: Enabling/disabling features dynamically.

A/B Testing: Comparing feature variations to optimize user experience.

📈 Outcome: Application is live, stable, monitored, and continuously improved.

🔁 7️⃣ Continuous Feedback and Monitoring

Looping Back to Planning

Monitoring insights and production feedback are shared with Product Owners.

Bugs or enhancement requests are logged as new Jira stories.

The cycle starts again, continuously improving quality and velocity.
